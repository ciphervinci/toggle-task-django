        <h1>Best place for maintaining and organising your tasks made by Rishikesh ! ðŸ¥° </h1>
        <p>Life is fun. But life is also busy. There's a million different things you could be doing. But what matters is <u>what</u> you do. I created <b><i>Toggle Task</i></b> to help you make sense of all of your opportunities and live that life that matters most to you. Your new organized life awaits.</p>
